Documents :
this is a collection of useful ML examples using Scikit learn, Keras, and Tensorflow. 

Included :
requirement’s file used to load in all dependencies in python

Training series 1 :
simple ML examples with clear instruction’s and example data

Training series 2 :
Slightly more advanced examples using techniques such as Neural Networks as well as Transfer Learning.

Deploy A Keras Model With Flask :
a full example of building a simple model using the Mnst data set and then sending it into deployment on a website
using flask.

note all examples where originally built in python 3.60 may not run as expected on other versions
